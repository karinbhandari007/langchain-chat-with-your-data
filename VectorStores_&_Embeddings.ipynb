Skipping ahead — let's see — for homework, one midterm, one open and term \\nproject. Notice on the honor code. So one thing that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this class more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you're sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also post on the class newsgroup if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this class are reasonably difficult. People that have \\ntaken the class before may tell you they were very difficult. And just I bet it would be \\nmore fun for you, and you'd probably have a better learning experience if you form a\""
